# Software Development Best Practices: Universal Guidelines

## Overview
This document captures proven methodologies, workflows, and best practices for creating robust, maintainable, and professional software projects. These recommendations serve as a blueprint for any software development project using modern development practices.

## 🎯 Core Development Philosophy

### 1. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) as Foundation
**Principle**: Define system behavior before implementation using human-readable specifications.

**Implementation**:
- **Gherkin Language**: Write specifications using Given-When-Then syntax
- **Living Documentation**: Specifications serve as both requirements and documentation
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Non-technical stakeholders can understand and validate requirements

**Example Structure**:
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to log into the system
  So that I can access my personal data

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I have a valid username and password
    When I submit the login form
    Then I should be logged in
    And I should see my dashboard
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- Reduces misunderstandings between team members
- Creates executable documentation
- Enables test-driven development

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with BDD Integration
**Principle**: Generate comprehensive test cases directly from BDD specifications.

**Workflow**:
1. **Write BDD Scenarios**: Define expected behavior in Gherkin
2. **Generate Test Cases**: Create unit tests that verify each scenario
3. **Implement Code**: Write minimum code to pass tests
4. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage
5. **Validate**: Ensure implementation matches BDD specifications

**Test Organization**:
```python
class TestUserAuthentication(unittest.TestCase):
    """Test cases for user authentication feature"""
    
    def test_successful_login(self):
        """
        Given I have a valid username and password
        When I submit the login form
        Then I should be logged in
        """
        # Implementation follows BDD scenario exactly
```

**Best Practices**:
- One test class per feature/component
- Test method names describe the scenario being tested
- Include BDD scenario in test docstring
- Aim for >85% test coverage of critical functionality
- Use descriptive assertions that explain what's being verified

### 3. Modern Platform Best Practices

#### Python/PyPI Projects:
**Package Structure**:
```
project/
├── src/package_name/           # Source code in src layout
│   ├── __init__.py            # Package exports
│   ├── core_module.py         # Core functionality
│   └── cli/                   # Command-line interfaces
├── tests/                     # Test suite
├── pyproject.toml            # Modern Python packaging
├── setup.py                  # Legacy compatibility
├── requirements.txt          # Dependencies
├── MANIFEST.in              # Package file inclusion
└── LICENSE                  # Open source license
```

**Key Elements**:
- **src/ Layout**: Prevents accidental imports during development
- **pyproject.toml**: Modern Python packaging standard

```

#### Cross-Platform Considerations:
- Use platform-appropriate path handling
- Handle different runtime environments gracefully
- Test on multiple operating systems
- Provide clear dependency installation instructions

### 4. Clean Architecture and Separation of Concerns
**Principle**: Organize code into focused, testable, and reusable components.

**Modular Design Principles**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Classes accept dependencies rather than creating them
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces rather than large ones
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification

**Benefits**:
- Easy unit testing of individual components
- Simplified debugging and maintenance
- Code reuse across different interfaces
- Clear boundaries between different concerns

### 5. User Experience Focus
**Principle**: Make software intuitive and helpful for users at all skill levels.

**Professional CLI Design**:
```bash
# Consistent naming convention
package-name-action-target

# Clear parameter structure
package-name-process "input" output --option value

# Comprehensive help
package-name-process --help
```

**UX Best Practices**:
- **Consistent Interfaces**: All tools follow the same patterns
- **Parameter Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid input
- **Progress Feedback**: Show users what's happening during long operations
- **Help Documentation**: Examples and usage instructions for every tool
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling with actionable error messages

### 6. Quality Assurance and Verification
**Principle**: Multiple layers of verification ensure reliability and correctness.

**Testing Strategy**:
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow verification
3. **BDD Validation**: Behavior matches specifications
4. **Performance Tests**: Quality vs. speed trade-offs
5. **Error Handling Tests**: Edge cases and invalid inputs

**Automated Quality Checks**:
```bash
# Comprehensive test suite
./test.sh                    # All tests with smart environment detection

# Specific test categories
npm test -- --grep "authentication"
pytest tests/ -k "user_management"
```

**Quality Metrics**:

   ```gherkin
   Scenario: New feature behavior
     Given initial conditions
     When action is performed
     Then expected result occurs
   ```

2. **Write Test Cases**:
   ```python
   def test_new_feature_behavior(self):
       """Test implementation matches BDD scenario"""
       # Given
       setup_initial_conditions()
       
       # When
       result = perform_action()
       
       # Then
       assert_expected_result(result)
   ```

3. **Implement Minimum Viable Code**:
   - Focus on making tests pass
   - Don't over-engineer initially
   - Keep implementation simple and clear

4. **Refactor and Improve**:
   - Optimize performance if needed
   - Improve code structure
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Ensure tests still pass

5. **Validate Against Requirements**:
   - Verify behavior matches specifications
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Update documentation

6. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with other system components
   - Verify interfaces work correctly
   - Check cross-platform compatibility

### 2. Quality Assurance Process

**Continuous Verification**:
```bash
# Before every commit
./test.sh                    # Run all tests
git add .                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "description"  # Commit with clear message

# Quality gates
# 1. All tests must pass
# 2. Code coverage maintained/improved

## 🔍 Critical Technical Insights - Hole Detection Case Study

### The Boolean Subtraction Solution
During development of the cable-tag project, we discovered a fundamental issue with 3D mesh hole generation that provides important insights for geometric processing:

**Problem Identified**: Using polygon-with-holes data structures and extruding them doesn't create actual holes in 3D meshes - it only calculates correct volumes.

**Root Cause**: Both Python (trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon) and Rust (Lyon tessellation) were creating meshes where hole areas were triangulated but not actually removed, resulting in solid-appearing models despite correct volume calculations.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- **Python**: Create separate meshes for outer shapes and holes, then use `outer_mesh.difference(hole_mesh)` boolean operations
- **Rust**: Use Lyon's tessellation with EvenOdd fill rule to properly handle polygons with holes during triangulation

**Key Learning**: For 3D geometry processing, **mathematical correctness doesn't guarantee visual correctness**. Always verify the final output, not just intermediate calculations.

### Verification Strategy
- **Volume Analysis**: Compare mesh volume to expected solid volume (should be significantly less)
- **Point-in-Mesh Tests**: Test if points inside hole areas return `False` for containment
- **Cross-Section Analysis**: Verify that cross-sections show multiple discrete paths
- **Visual Inspection**: Use multiple viewers and file formats for validation

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# WRONG: Creates polygon with holes but solid mesh
poly_with_holes = Polygon(outer_coords, [hole_coords])
mesh = trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon(poly_with_holes, height)

# CORRECT: Boolean subtraction for actual holes
outer_mesh = trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon(outer_poly, height)
hole_mesh = trimesh.creation.extrude_polygon(hole_poly, height)
final_mesh = outer_mesh.difference(hole_mesh)
```

This pattern applies to any geometric processing where holes or negative space must be preserved in the final output.

## 🚀 AWS ECS GPU Deployment Insights - langsam-cloud Case Study (July 26, 2025)

### Critical Configuration Discovery: Security Group Port Requirements

During the deployment of the `lang-segment-anything` ML application to AWS ECS with GPU support, we discovered critical infrastructure configuration requirements that are essential for successful container deployments.

**Problem Identified**: Container health checks failing despite correct application startup and port configuration.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Application**: Running correctly on port 8000 inside container ✅
- **ECS Task**: Port mapping 8000→8000 configured correctly ✅  
- **Target Group**: Health check configured for port 8000 ✅
- **Load Balancer**: Listener routing port 80→8000 correctly ✅
- **Security Group**: ❌ **Missing port 8000 access from VPC**

**Solution Implemented**:
```bash
# Critical fix: Add port 8000 to EC2 instance security group
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-03b6dfedf7c42cfcc \
  --protocol tcp --port 8000 --cidr 10.0.0.0/16
```

### Key Architecture Lessons

#### 1. Security Group Port Alignment
**Principle**: Every port used in the application stack must be explicitly allowed in security groups.

**Common Mistake**: Assuming ECS port mappings automatically configure security groups.

**Best Practice**: 
- Document all port flows: ALB → Target Group → Instance → Container
- Verify security group rules match every port in the chain
- Test connectivity at each layer independently

#### 2. Health Check Endpoint Discovery
**Application-Specific Finding**: LitServe applications work with root endpoint `/` for health checks.

**Investigation Process**:
1. **Container Logs Analysis**: Found "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"
2. **Framework Research**: LitServe + Gradio structure documented
3. **Endpoint Testing**: Tried `/health`, `/docs`, `/gradio`, `/` (successful)

**Pattern Recognition**: Different ML frameworks have different default endpoints:
- **FastAPI**: `/docs`, `/health` (if implemented)
- **LitServe**: `/` (root), `/predict`, `/gradio`
- **Flask**: Application-dependent

#### 3. Existing Container Utilization Strategy
**Success Factor**: Used existing `lang-segment-anything:latest` ECR image without rebuilds.

**Benefits Realized**:
- **Zero Code Changes**: Avoided development cycle delays
- **Faster Deployment**: No container build pipeline required  
- **Risk Reduction**: Used proven, tested container image
- **Team Alignment**: Leveraged existing team assets

**Implementation Approach**:
- Analyzed existing container configuration through logs
- Adapted infrastructure to match container requirements
- Fixed infrastructure gaps rather than modifying application

### Production Deployment Checklist

Based on this successful deployment, here's a verified checklist for AWS ECS GPU deployments:

#### Infrastructure Prerequisites
- [ ] **GPU Instance**: Confirm g4dn.xlarge with NVIDIA drivers
- [ ] **ECS Cluster**: Verify container instance registration

- [ ] **Resource Allocation**: Set appropriate CPU, memory, GPU (1 unit)
- [ ] **Health Check**: Identify correct endpoint for framework
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Configure as needed

#### Security Configuration
- [ ] **Security Groups**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Allow application port from VPC
- [ ] **IAM Roles**: ECS task execution and task roles configured
- [ ] **Load Balancer**: Target group and listener configuration
- [ ] **Network ACLs**: Verify subnet-level access

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] **Container Status**: Verify RUNNING state
- [ ] **Target Health**: Confirm HEALTHY in load balancer
