## Feature: GPU Compute Instance Deployment

**As a** ML engineer  
**I want** to deploy a GPU-enabled compute instance in a private subnet  
**So that** I can run machine learning workloads securely and efficiently  

### Scenario: Deploy g4dn.xlarge instance in development environment
```gherkin
Given the networking layer is deployed and operational
And the development environment parameters are configured
And I have valid AWS credentials with appropriate permissions
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh create dev"
Then a g4dn.xlarge EC2 instance should be created
And the instance should be placed in a private subnet
And the instance should have NVIDIA T4 GPU available
And the instance should have Deep Learning AMI installed
And the stack status should be "CREATE_COMPLETE"
And the operation should complete within 10 minutes
```

### Scenario: Validate GPU functionality on deployed instance
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is running in the development environment
When I connect to the instance via Session Manager
And I execute "nvidia-smi" command
Then I should see GPU information displayed
And CUDA drivers should be properly installed
And GPU memory should be available for allocation
And ML frameworks should be accessible
```

### Scenario: Instance deployment with custom instance type
```gherkin
Given the networking layer is deployed
And I want to test with a smaller instance type
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh create dev --instance-type t3.medium"
Then a t3.medium instance should be created instead of g4dn.xlarge
And all other configurations should remain the same
And the deployment should succeed
```

## Feature: Infrastructure Security and Network Integration

**As a** security engineer  
**I want** compute instances to follow security best practices  
**So that** ML workloads are protected and network access is controlled  

### Scenario: Instance deployed in private subnet
```gherkin
Given the compute stack is being created
When the EC2 instance is launched
Then the instance should be placed in one of the existing private subnets
And the instance should not have a public IP address
And the instance should route internet traffic through NAT gateway
And the instance should be able to reach the internet for package updates
```

### Scenario: Security group configuration for ML workloads
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is being deployed
When the security group is created
Then it should allow outbound internet access for package installation
And it should allow inbound access from within the VPC
And it should support Session Manager connectivity
And it should deny direct SSH access from the internet
And it should prepare for future API integration ports
```

### Scenario: IAM role with least privilege access
```gherkin
Given a compute instance requires AWS service access
When the IAM role is created
Then it should include CloudWatch logging permissions
And it should include S3 access for model storage
And it should include Session Manager permissions
And it should include ECR access for future container use
And it should not include unnecessary administrative permissions
```

## Feature: Management Script Automation

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** a comprehensive management script for compute layer lifecycle  
**So that** I can manage instances consistently across environments  

### Scenario: Create compute stack successfully
```gherkin
Given I have the manage-compute.sh script
And the networking layer is operational
And environment parameters are configured
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh create dev"
Then the CloudFormation template should be validated
And the stack should be created successfully
And stack outputs should be displayed
And the operation should be logged appropriately
```

### Scenario: Display stack status and instance information
```gherkin
Given a compute stack exists in the development environment
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh status dev"
Then I should see the stack status
And I should see instance state information
And I should see recent stack events
And I should see GPU utilization if available
And I should see estimated cost information
```

### Scenario: Validate template without deployment
```gherkin
Given I want to test template changes
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh validate"
Then the CloudFormation template should be syntax validated
And parameter validation should be performed
And no actual resources should be created
And validation results should be clearly reported
```

### Scenario: Delete compute stack with cleanup
```gherkin
Given a compute stack exists in the development environment
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh delete dev"
Then all compute resources should be terminated
And the CloudFormation stack should be deleted
And no orphaned resources should remain
And the operation should complete within 5 minutes
```

### Scenario: Force delete failed stack
```gherkin
Given a compute stack is in ROLLBACK_FAILED state
When I execute "./manage-compute.sh delete dev --force-delete"
Then the script should attempt stack deletion
And it should handle resource dependencies gracefully
And it should provide detailed error information
And it should suggest manual cleanup steps if needed
```

---

## Feature: Cross-Stack Integration

**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** the compute layer to integrate seamlessly with the networking layer  
**So that** infrastructure components work together cohesively  

### Scenario: Reference networking layer exports
```gherkin
Given the networking layer is deployed with proper exports
When the compute stack is being created
Then it should import VPC ID from networking layer exports
And it should import private subnet IDs from networking layer exports
And it should import security group ID from networking layer exports
And cross-stack references should resolve correctly
```

### Scenario: Consistent naming and tagging
```gherkin
Given organizational naming standards are defined
When compute resources are created
Then resource names should follow the pattern "{ProjectName}-{Environment}-{ResourceType}"
And all resources should be tagged with Project, Environment, and Layer
And tags should be consistent with networking layer tagging
And resources should be easily identifiable
```

### Scenario: Environment parameter support
```gherkin
Given multiple environments are supported (dev, test, staging, prod)
When I deploy to any environment
Then environment-specific parameter files should be used
And resource configurations should adapt to environment requirements
And naming should include environment identifier
And configurations should be isolated between environments
```

## Feature: Cost Management and Optimization

**As a** cost manager  
**I want** visibility and control over compute costs  
**So that** ML infrastructure operates within budget constraints  

### Scenario: Cost estimation for running instances
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is running
When I check the instance cost information
Then I should see hourly cost estimates
And I should see daily and monthly projections
And I should see GPU vs compute cost breakdown
And cost information should be updated regularly
```

### Scenario: Idle instance detection
```gherkin
Given a compute instance has been running for 2 hours
When the instance has low CPU and GPU utilization
Then the monitoring system should detect idle state
And administrators should be notified
And automatic shutdown options should be available
And cost savings should be calculated
```

### Scenario: Right-sizing recommendations
```gherkin
Given historical usage data is available
When instance utilization patterns are analyzed
Then the system should recommend optimal instance types
And cost optimization suggestions should be provided
And performance impact should be assessed
And migration strategies should be outlined
```

## Feature: Monitoring and Observability

**As a** operations engineer  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of compute infrastructure  
**So that** I can ensure reliable ML workload execution  

### Scenario: CloudWatch metrics collection
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is running
When CloudWatch monitoring is enabled
Then CPU utilization metrics should be collected
And memory usage should be monitored
And disk I/O metrics should be available
And network performance should be tracked
And custom ML metrics should be supported
```

### Scenario: GPU monitoring and alerting
```gherkin
Given a GPU-enabled instance is running
When GPU monitoring is configured
Then GPU utilization should be tracked
And GPU memory usage should be monitored
And GPU temperature should be watched
And alerts should trigger on GPU failures
And performance baselines should be established
```

### Scenario: Session Manager connectivity verification
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is deployed in a private subnet
When I attempt to connect via Session Manager
Then the connection should be established successfully
And I should have shell access to the instance
And the connection should be secure and audited
And no direct internet access should be required
```

## Feature: ML Environment Validation

**As a** data scientist  
**I want** a properly configured ML environment on the compute instance  
**So that** I can run machine learning workloads immediately  

### Scenario: Deep Learning AMI validation
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is launched with Deep Learning AMI
When the instance finishes initialization
Then Python 3.x should be installed and accessible
And CUDA toolkit should be properly configured
And cuDNN libraries should be available
And GPU-enabled frameworks should be installed
```

### Scenario: ML framework availability
```gherkin
Given the ML environment is set up
When I test framework installations
Then TensorFlow with GPU support should be available
And PyTorch with CUDA support should work
And Jupyter notebook should be accessible
And Common ML libraries should be pre-installed
And package managers should work for additional installations
```

### Scenario: Storage configuration for ML workloads
```gherkin
Given a compute instance requires data storage
When storage is configured
Then the root volume should have sufficient space (50GB+)
And additional EBS volumes should be attachable
And S3 access should be configured for data sets
And temporary storage should be available for processing
```

## Feature: Security and Access Control

**As a** security administrator  
**I want** secure access patterns for compute resources  
**So that** ML infrastructure follows security best practices  

### Scenario: No direct SSH access from internet
```gherkin
Given a compute instance is deployed
When security configurations are applied
Then the instance should not accept SSH from 0.0.0.0/0
And Session Manager should be the primary access method
And access should be logged and auditable
And network access should be restricted to VPC
```

### Scenario: Encrypted storage requirements
```gherkin
Given security requirements for data protection
When EBS volumes are created
Then root volume should be encrypted at rest
And additional volumes should use encryption
And encryption keys should be managed properly
And backup data should be encrypted
```

### Scenario: Network traffic encryption
```gherkin
Given data security requirements
When network communication occurs
Then traffic within VPC should use secure protocols
And external API calls should use HTTPS/TLS
And model data transfer should be encrypted
And monitoring traffic should be secure
```

## Feature: Disaster Recovery and Backup

**As a** reliability engineer  
**I want** backup and recovery capabilities for compute infrastructure  
**So that** ML workloads can recover from failures quickly  

### Scenario: EBS snapshot creation
```gherkin
Given a compute instance with important data
When backup procedures are executed
Then EBS volumes should be snapshot automatically
And snapshots should be retained per policy
And restoration procedures should be documented
And backup verification should be performed
```

### Scenario: Instance replacement capability
```gherkin
Given a compute instance fails unexpectedly
When replacement procedures are initiated
Then a new instance should be launchable from template
And data should be recoverable from snapshots
And ML environment should be quickly restored
And service continuity should be maintained
```
